# mmdb

mmdb is a website that allows users to keep tract of their manga reading-lists! 

It uses the Jikan API to look up entries and uses React's localDatabase to store them in your lists.

## Future Updates
This project was created with scalability in mind, so the following are changes that I am working on:
* Use an online database to store entries (Firebase/mongoDB)
* Create a login page for users
* Create a profile page that users can customize
